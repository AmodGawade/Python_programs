How it looks ?

list = [a,b,c,e,d]
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
list = ['Applie', 'Orange', 'Mango']
list = [0, 'a', "Amod",12.7]
list must be enclosed by []. Contents with comma separated any data type values as list elements

a = [0,1,2.5, 'Dhana']
#my a is list

you can do arithmetic operations
you can create an empty list and add  elements later
